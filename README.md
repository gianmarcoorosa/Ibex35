# Ibex35 Analysis

This repository contains the code for a project completed as part of the course **Statistical Methods for Finance** during my bachelor's degree. The task was to identify the best GARCH model based on information criteria and prediction capability for the Ibex 35 total return index.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze the Ibex 35 total return index by fitting various GARCH models and comparing them using statistical tests to evaluate their prediction capabilities.

## Contents

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Performed EDA to understand the data and compare it with theoretical expectations.

- **Modeling:**  
  Fitted several types of GARCH models using the `Rugarch` package in R.

- **Model Comparison:**  
  Compared different GARCH models based on information criteria and prediction capability.

- **Prediction Testing:**  
  Conducted the Newey-West test to assess the robustness of the model predictions.

## Tools and Libraries

- **R:** Programming language used for the analysis.
- **Rugarch:** R package used for fitting GARCH models.
